[Metallica](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2ye2Wgw4gimLv2eAKyk1NB?si=MI4Sf8GySgGy0OzCaCnn2A) has been a part of my life since I was very young. My father would play their music whenever we were in his truck.

Here are some songs by Metallica:
* Master of Puppets
* Enter Sandman
* Nothing Else Matters

### Led Zeppelin

[Led Zeppelin](https://open.spotify.com/artist/36QJpDe2go2KgaRleHCDTp?si=NW8bi1CuRAuF8KTkXQDVyg) changed the way rock music was percieved. At times they played classic blues songs, but other times they would be incredibly technical and groundbreaking. All musicians within the band were well known before the band was born. Some might say this made them a "supergroup."

Here are some songs by Led Zeppelin:
* Stairway to Heaven
* Blackdog
* Heartbreaker

### Foo Fighters

I found [Foo Fighters](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7jy3rLJdDQY21OgRLCZ9sD?si=IU_CohwKSq6r3THd5FyGWA) through being a fan of Nirvana. The singer, Dave Grohl, was the drummer of Nirvana. I enjoy how loud and aggressive their music is.

Here are some songs by Foo Fighters:
* Times Like These
* Everlong
* My Hero
